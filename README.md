# burger-buddy

Burger buddy is a command-line app for ordering food from an imaginary takeout restaurant. The purpose of building this app was to refresh myself on java syntax as I have been predominantly working in Javascript and Ruby as of recent. This project was lead with TDD principles in mind and was tested with Junit.

## How to run

## The commands 

## Improvements

At present, as stated this is purely a command-line application, I think adding a GUI in the future would be a nice touch to flesh the app out a little more. However Java is not typically what would use to make an app like, but as I mentioned previously the purpose of this project was to refresh my memory of java syntax.
